####Teensy 3.6 audio display project

I'd like to make a pcb to house my teensy 3.6, the sgtl5000 audioboard and an ILI9341 lcd display. 

Currently I've wired the three components together using breadboard and jumper wires. Although this does work intermittently, the digital audio connection (i2s) is very fragile and mostly results in heavy digital distorion. 

Fritzing seems to be my easiest option to build a pcb. Maybe later I will check out oshpark.com

My first step is to build svg files for breadboard view, schematic view and pcb view for fritzing. This is my first pcb project.
